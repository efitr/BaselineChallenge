# Recursion

This folder using many different types of documents will track my efforts to fully master recursion.

This will performed using this documents, each will have next to it an explanation of what it provides:
   - problems.py - while performing problems in leetcode I will copy the problem here, the link and the solution. Each solution will be fully broken down into diagrams that explain how they achieve the solution, plus their time and space constraints, there will be multiple solutions, in most cases my solutions but sometimes other people who shared their answer, due credit will be given to that person with a link to their answer. My goal is to compare based on submitting at least 5 times how the code measures up to Leetcode test suit, and how other solutions measure up too. This was I can grow more and later probably make even greater solutions. 
   - problems_test.py - while I will be relaying heavily in Leetcode test suit to compare my algorithms I also desire to practice making tests and challenging my code, so the test suits I make will work hard to break my code even if passing Leetcode test suit, this way I'm practicing further how to strengthen my code.
   - RecursionExplanation.md - This will carry every single way in which I found to be capable of performing recursion on a type of problem, then will break it down into steps that show how recursion happened to finish explaining in what sort of situations this approach can be best for with how it affects the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
   - Abstract.(md or py) - this is meant to be sort of a seminal work on recursion, fully capturing all it is, using the diagrams and explanation based on all I have worked on this folder. Its complete state is not ready yet but is in progress.
