# BaselineChallenge
This is a project meant with the goal of fully challenging my knowledge of what I consider my Baseline Knowledge, challenging it until there is nothing that I don't absolutely and fully understand.

This challenge begins by creating every point within my Baseline Knowledge using Python, to later also go through the same road with, TypeScript, Swift, Go, Rust, and C, while it is very unlikely I will add another programming language, I might change my mind.

The goal of the process is for me to first master my Baseline Knowledge which was designed using for inspiration every single Computer Science class I ever had, from that core build it all using first Python, to later move to do the same with another programming language, while at the beginning it is about Python and CS, through practice and growth, I believe the process of tackling the same knowledge with a new programming language will strengthen my understanding of my Baseline Knowledge, further help me understand and learn other programming languages easier, and create an intuitive understanding of the differences of each programming language to a very high degree.

## My baseline knowledge looks as follows:

    - For every algorithm, have a time complexity and space complexity analysis performed on it.
